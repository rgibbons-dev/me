I am a 24-year old, employed software developer tinkering away on Jenkins pipelines and Angular 12 applications. I've seen a lot of movies, not enough by my standards but a lot, but am working at leaving my mistress, the Silver Screen, to renew vows with the paperback. Either way, I love the Image. Whether it comes from Cather's words in print or some ephemeral TikTok, there's no running from that one. I'm getting around to finishing the *Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs*.
