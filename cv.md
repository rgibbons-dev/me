## Professional Experience:

### DTCC :: DevSecOps Engineer

* **About:** Member of two teams, one of which maintains a Jenkins Shared Library, while for another I own and maintain two web applications.

* **Took full ownership of and revitalized a web application from neglected to production-ready**. Previously, this was used sparingly in limited demonstrations, because most of it didn't work. Since I have been involved, it is now the preferred way to interact with the underlying system, rather than the API.

* **Implemented new features involving artifact deployments for a Jenkins Shared Library**. I saved the team overseeing releases a lot of time reading logs by identifying a previously uncaught error and centralizing relevant information releated to the failure(s). 

* **I gave multiple live demonstrations of my work and am invited to do so regularly by colleagues**. I put a lot of effort into presentations, and this has not only improved my public speaking skills but also facilitated effective knowledge tranfer across teams, based on feedback I have received.

* **Technologies used**: Jenkins, Groovy, Angular, Typescript, Java, Spring Boot, Postgres, Git.

### DTCC :: Java Developer

* **About:** Developed web applications.

* **Core contributor to several Angular/Spring/Postgres web applications**. I gained a solid foundation in the company's stack and their Git workflow.

* **I wrote hundreds of tests to bring four large web applications into compliance with company standards**. One of the new qualifiers for production-readiness was test coverage.

* **Technologies used**: Angular, Typescript, Java, Spring Boot, Postgres, Git
